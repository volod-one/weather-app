# Weather Forecast App

## Overview

The Weather Forecast App is a mobile application designed to provide users with up-to-date weather information for multiple cities. The app follows the principles of Clean Architecture, ensuring a modular and maintainable codebase, and employs the MVVM pattern for efficient separation of concerns.

## Features

- **City List:** View a list of added cities with their current weather information.
- **Detailed Weather:** Tap on a city to access a detailed forecast for that location.
- **Add Cities:** Use the FAB button to add new cities manually or based on coordinates.
- **User Location:** Add the current user's location to the city list with a dedicated button.
- **Remove Cities:** Easily remove cities from the list on the detailed weather screen.

## Tech Stack

- **Architecture:** Clean Architecture
- **Design Pattern:** MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- **Language:** Kotlin

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following modules:

- **data:** Includes implementations of Repositories responsible for data handling.
- **di:** Contains the dependency injection modules for the app.
- **domain:** Houses Entities representing core data models and Use Cases containing business logic.
- **ui:** Contains the UI components (Activities/Fragments), Adapters, and ViewModels.
- **util:** Includes utility classes and extensions.
